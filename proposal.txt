For this exercise you are going to submit a proposal for your final project. 

For your final project in this course you will work in teams of 2 on a project of your own design. 
We want you to come up with a project that you're excited to work on.

Proposal Expectations:

The instructors will be grading your project proposals. They will provide you with feedback on the 
feasibility and appropriateness of your project ideas. For the purpose of marking this exercise, 
you will be graded on the quality of your project proposal. To achieve full marks for this exercise,
your proposal must be succinct and clear on what you intend to do. Additionally, you must show that 
you have thoughtfully broken the task down into well-defined milestones with expected completion dates. 

For your project proposal, you must submit a document (Plain text, rich text or pdf files ONLY. DO 
NOT submit a .doc or .docx file) containing the following:

* Project Title
* Team Members Full Names (note you must work on a team of 2 for the project)
Brief description of what your project idea is. Be clear on what the demonstration at the end will 
look like.
* Document 3-6 Milestones for your project. Estimate how long each milestone will take  and give an 
expected completion date. Give a 2-3 sentence description of what you expect to do for each milestone.
Each milestone should be up to a weeks worth of work. You should have something to demo at the end of 
each milestone. Be explicit about what the demo for each milestone would be. Note we do NOT want to see
milestones where each milestone implements a separate, non demonstrate-able piece of code and the final
milestone is to integrate them all together. This is bad planning and can leave you without a demo-able
project if you fail to reach the integration milestone.
If the instructors have concerns about your proposal (i.e. your idea is too big or too small, or your 
milestones are not appropriately defined etc.) they will provide you with feedback and you will be 
required to revise your proposal until it is appropriate. You will only be graded on the first submission.

Project Expectations:

Our expectations/criteria for a good project are:

your project should be approximately the same size as one of the assignments we had you do in class. 
This should be something you can reasonably complete in approximately 3-4 weeks.
your project should demonstrate your command of the material covered in class. It should demonstrate 
your ability to write clean, efficient code, and your ability to solve algorithmically challenging 
problems. Consider that a lot of focus this term has been on algorithms, like search and dynamic 
programming. Additionally, when we say clean & efficient code, you should write code using good style
and should be mindful of the time complexity of your code.
Your project should be "demo-able" and demonstrate your ability to work with python in some capacity.
You may choose to also use the Arduino, however it is not a requirement.

Your project will be graded in two phases. First, you will be asked to demo your project on the last 
day of classes. You will demo your project for one of the instructors and a TA. After the demo, they
will ask you questions about your project. You will be graded both on the quality of your presentation 
and on your ability to answer these questions. Second, you will be asked to submit your code so it 
can be graded for style, efficiency and quality.

Title: 
(Untitled for now)

Description: 
Plan is to create an information website where users can gain information 
about a particular topic. We still haven't decided on a topic yet but we 
will be using data from the Canadian government's open database. 
The general idea of the programming part of the project is to have a 
server (the python) and a client (the website) communicate to each other
similar to what we did in the previous Assignment. The Objective of the 
our project will be to learn and understand how the server/client 
communication is done over the Internet. 
We are also going to try to get our project working on the web, so that
any potential user can visit our web-page.


Milestones (Date of Expected Completion): 
	1. Set up Flask (Mar 14th weekend)
			Based on the initial reading of how Flask works, we'll need 
			to set it up as a python server. Once we get it to display
			a simple web-page we will need to do the initial preparations
			for our website.
	2. Simple templates (Mar 21st weekend)
			Once Flask is set up we can create the HTML templates for 
			the website. The templates will need to be ready to be
			handed data from the server while loading to be displayed
			to the user. 
	3. Push server data to website (Mar 28th weekend)
			Once the templates are ready to receive data, we can create
			python program to parse the data from the data files to be 
			delivered to the website. This will be similar to the 
			previous exercises that required the use of parsing a CSV 
			file. 
	4. CSS and bug fixes (Apr 11th weekend)
			At this point the entire website should be working, we'll 
			just want to make it look pretty and fix any bugs in the 
			program!
